+ By: Chutian Gao
+ Production URL: <http://p2.findcharlie.me>

## Outside resources
+ Bootstrap 3.3: <https://getbootstrap.com/docs/3.3/getting-started/>
+ Form Class: <https://github.com/susanBuck/dwa15-php/blob/master/includes/Form.php>

## Code style divergences
+ When definning variables, I used multiple spaces before `=`  in order to make the values are aligned. 
+ In Associate Arrays, I used multiple spaces before or after `=>` in order to make the keys and values are aligned to the left.
